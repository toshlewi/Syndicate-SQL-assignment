# Bookstore Database README

## Overview
This project is designed to manage the operations of a bookstore, including books, authors, customers, orders, publishers, and other related entities. The database is built on MySQL and uses a normalized relational structure with foreign keys to enforce integrity.

### Database Structure
The database includes the following tables:

1. **book_language**: Stores supported languages for books.
2. **publisher**: Stores details about the publishers.
3. **book**: Stores details about books including title, publication date, price, and associated language and publisher.
4. **author**: Stores author names.
5. **book_author**: A junction table to represent the many-to-many relationship between books and authors.
6. **customer**: Stores customer details.
7. **address**: Stores customer addresses.
8. **country**: Stores country details for addresses.
9. **address_status**: Represents the status of an address (e.g., Home, Work, etc.).
10. **customer_address**: Represents the relationship between customers and their addresses.
11. **order_status**: Defines the various order statuses (Pending, Shipped, Delivered, etc.).
12. **cust_order**: Stores customer orders, including their shipping address and status.
13. **shipping_method**: Stores different shipping methods and their associated costs.
14. **order_history**: Tracks the status changes for each order.
15. **order_line**: Represents each book in an order, including quantity and price.

## Queries for Data Retrieval

Below are some sample SQL queries to retrieve useful data from the database.

### 1. Get All Books and Their Authors
```sql
SELECT b.title, a.author_name
FROM book b
JOIN book_author ba ON b.book_id = ba.book_id
JOIN author a ON ba.author_id = a.author_id;
```

### 2. Get All Orders Placed by a Specific Customer
```sql
SELECT o.order_id, o.order_date, o.order_total, os.status_name
FROM cust_order o
JOIN order_status os ON o.status_id = os.status_id
WHERE o.customer_id = 1; -- Replace 1 with the customer_id you want to query
```

### 3. Get All Orders of a Specific Book
```sql
SELECT o.order_id, o.order_date, ol.quantity, b.title
FROM order_line ol
JOIN cust_order o ON ol.order_id = o.order_id
JOIN book b ON ol.book_id = b.book_id
WHERE b.book_id = 1; -- Replace 1 with the book_id you want to query
```

### 4. Get All Books in a Specific Language
```sql
SELECT b.title
FROM book b
JOIN book_language bl ON b.language_id = bl.language_id
WHERE bl.language_name = 'English'; -- Replace 'English' with the language you want to query
```

### 5. Get Total Sales for a Specific Publisher
```sql
SELECT p.first_name, p.last_name, SUM(ol.quantity * ol.price) AS total_sales
FROM publisher p
JOIN book b ON p.publisher_id = b.publisher_id
JOIN order_line ol ON b.book_id = ol.book_id
GROUP BY p.publisher_id;
```

### 6. Get Customer Details with Their Addresses
```sql
SELECT c.first_name, c.last_name, a.street, a.city, co.country_name, as.status_name
FROM customer c
JOIN customer_address ca ON c.customer_id = ca.customer_id
JOIN address a ON ca.address_id = a.address_id
JOIN country co ON a.country_id = co.country_id
JOIN address_status as ON ca.status_id = as.status_id
WHERE c.customer_id = 1; -- Replace 1 with the customer_id you want to query
```

### 7. Get All Shipping Methods and Their Costs
```sql
SELECT method_name, cost
FROM shipping_method;
```

### 8. Get Order History for a Specific Order
```sql
SELECT oh.status_date, os.status_name
FROM order_history oh
JOIN order_status os ON oh.status_id = os.status_id
WHERE oh.order_id = 1; -- Replace 1 with the order_id you want to query
```

## How to Use

1. **Set up the database**:
   - Download the SQL script and run it in your MySQL environment to set up the bookstore database.
   - Ensure that you have the correct privileges to create databases, tables, and insert data.

2. **ER Diagram**:
   - To visualize the schema, an ER diagram has been included. You can use the diagram to better understand the relationships between tables.
   
3. **SQL Queries**:
   - Use the sample SQL queries above to extract data based on your requirements.
   - You can modify the `WHERE` clauses in the queries to target specific records as needed.

4. **User Roles**:
   - The following user roles have been created with specific privileges:
     - **admin**: Full privileges on the database.
     - **sales**: Limited access to sales-related tables (e.g., customer, orders).
     - **inventory**: Full access to book and author management.
     - **user_view**: Read-only access to the database.

## Conclusion
This database allows for comprehensive management of a bookstore, including handling books, orders, customers, and shipping. The provided SQL queries can help retrieve important data and generate insights for the bookstoreâ€™s operations.

For any changes or queries specific to your business needs, modify the existing queries or add new ones as needed.
